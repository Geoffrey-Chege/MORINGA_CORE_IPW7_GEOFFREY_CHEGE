# Description
I am a Data Scientist hired by the company Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience.

I have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Afterwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

# Experimental Design
1. Data Reading & Cleaning
2. Performing EDA
3. Performing necessary feature engineering
4. Performing regression analysis with the following models:
    - Multiple Linear Regression
    - Quantile Regression
    - Ridge Regression
    - Lasso Regression
    - Elastic Net Regression
5. Incorporating categorical independent variables into the models.
6. Checking for multicollinearity
7. Providing a recommendation based on my analysis:
  * Creating residual plots for my models, and assessing heteroskedasticity using Barlett's test.
8. Challenging my solution by providing insights on how to make improvements in the model.
